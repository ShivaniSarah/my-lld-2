pom.xml

It will download dependencies from maven repository: https://mvnrepository.com/
The pom.xml file in a Spring project is essential because it manages project dependencies
and configurations using Maven, which is a build automation tool.

Dependency Management: It declares the dependencies (libraries and frameworks) 
needed for your Spring project. Maven handles downloading and managing these libraries automatically,
ensuring compatibility and avoiding version conflicts.

Build Lifecycle: Maven provides a structured lifecycle for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Plugin Management: It includes plugins for compiling code, running tests, generating reports, and 
packaging the application (e.g., into a JAR or WAR file).
Version Management: It makes it easy to manage versions of your dependencies and plugins, 
allowing for clean upgrades and patches.
Multi-Module Support: Maven supports multi-module projects, allowing you to manage multiple related projects under a single pom.xml.
