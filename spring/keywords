Spring MVC

pom.xml

It will download dependencies from maven repository: https://mvnrepository.com/
The pom.xml file in a Spring project is essential because it manages project dependencies
and configurations using Maven, which is a build automation tool.

Dependency Management: It declares the dependencies (libraries and frameworks) 
needed for your Spring project. Maven handles downloading and managing these libraries automatically,
ensuring compatibility and avoiding version conflicts.

Build Lifecycle: Maven provides a structured lifecycle for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Plugin Management: It includes plugins for compiling code, running tests, generating reports, and 
packaging the application (e.g., into a JAR or WAR file).
Version Management: It makes it easy to manage versions of your dependencies and plugins, 
allowing for clean upgrades and patches.
Multi-Module Support: Maven supports multi-module projects, allowing you to manage multiple related projects under a single pom.xml.

Maven is primarily a command-line interface (CLI) tool used for building and managing Java-based projects.
It automates the process of project compilation, dependency management, packaging, and more. 
Developers interact with Maven through a series of commands issued in a terminal or command prompt.

Maven wrapper properties and script files like mvnw for linux and mvnw.cmd for windows are there means that we can use maven commands to run
the maven repo

The Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) Container is a core component of the Spring Framework that is responsible for managing the lifecycle, configuration, and dependencies of the objects (also known as beans) within a Spring application.

Inversion of Control (IOC)
Inversion of Control is a design principle where the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application to a container (like the Spring IOC container). This allows developers to delegate the responsibility of managing dependencies and object lifecycle to the container rather than doing it manually within the application code.

Spring Actuator:
In Spring, an actuator provides features to help monitor and manage an application in production. Spring Boot Actuator includes a set of built-in endpoints that allow you to interact with your Spring Boot application, monitor its state, gather metrics, check health, and even modify runtime properties.
Key Features of Spring Boot Actuator:
Health Check: Monitor the status of the application (e.g., UP or DOWN).
Metrics: Track various metrics such as memory usage, CPU, HTTP request counts, and response times.
Auditing: Provides auditing information like user login and access events.
Tracing: Helps track application traces for debugging purposes.
HTTP Endpoints: Actuators expose various endpoints via HTTP to manage and monitor the application.
Common Actuator Endpoints:
/actuator/health: Provides application health information.
/actuator/metrics: Displays various application metrics.
/actuator/info: Displays application information.
/actuator/env: Exposes properties from the environment.
/actuator/loggers: Manage and view logging configuration.
/actuator/httptrace: Provides tracing information for recent HTTP requests.
