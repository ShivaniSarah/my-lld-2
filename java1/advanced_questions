Multithreaded Hotel Booking System

Multiple users can try booking the same room concurrently.

Ensure no overbooking happens.




Design a Concurrent Web Server

Handle HTTP requests using a thread pool.

Support timeouts, back-pressure, and graceful shutdown.



Multithreaded Game Engine Loop

Separate threads for rendering, physics, AI, and sound.

Ensure they are coordinated with minimal lag.



Thread-safe Chat Server

Support multiple chat rooms and multiple users per room.

Ensure messages are broadcasted correctly and in order.



Multithreaded Metrics Aggregator

Design a service to collect metrics (CPU, memory, custom events) from multiple sources in parallel.

Ensure correct aggregation and time-window support.




Distributed Lock Implementation with Threads

Simulate a distributed lock mechanism like Zookeeper or Redis Redlock using local threads.



Multithreaded Web Scraper with Retry & Throttling

Ensure you do not violate rate limits.

Retry failed requests with exponential backoff.




Concurrent Billing Engine

Calculate user bills from millions of usage events.

Ensure each bill is calculated exactly once, even with concurrent threads.



Asynchronous Workflow Engine

Design a system where tasks are executed in a predefined DAG (directed acyclic graph), and nodes are processed concurrently respecting dependencies.



Concurrency Patterns & Optimizations

Compare Spinlocks vs Blocking Locks

How to minimize context switches in high-throughput systems?

Design a backpressure mechanism for producer-consumer scenarios.

What are lock-free and wait-free data structures? Design a lock-free queue.

Design a job retry and deduplication service using multiple threads.
