A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a package file format in Java that bundles together multiple Java classes, metadata, and resources (like text files or images) into a single compressed file. It is essentially a ZIP file with a .jar extension, designed specifically for distributing and deploying Java applications or libraries.

Key Features of a JAR File:
Packaging: A JAR file packages together all the Java .class files (compiled bytecode), libraries, and other resources needed by a Java application. This makes it easier to distribute and deploy Java applications.

Execution: A JAR file can be executable if it contains a Main-Class entry in its MANIFEST.MF file (metadata for the JAR). This allows you to run the application from the command line directly using:

java -jar myapp.jar

Random Access Interface

----------

Marker Interface

âœ… Marker Interface in Java
A Marker Interface is an interface without any methods or fields. It is used to mark or tag a class to indicate some metadata to the JVM or frameworks at runtime.

ðŸ”§ Examples in Java:
Serializable â€“ Marks a class as serializable

Cloneable â€“ Allows object cloning using clone()

Remote â€“ Indicates remote method invocation (RMI)

RandomAccess â€“ Marks fast random access in List implementations like ArrayList

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Instead of functionality, itâ€™s used for:

Type identification

Special treatment by Java runtime or frameworks


----------


Iterable

----------


Load Factor of hashmap
Load Factor is a measure of how full the HashMap can get before it needs to resize (rehash). It is defined as:
loadFactor = numberOfEntries / capacity

----------

âœ… Functional Interface in Java
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It can have default or static methods, but only one method must be abstract.

ðŸ§  Why it matters:
Functional interfaces are the foundation of lambda expressions and method references in Java (from Java 8 onward).

âœ… Example:

@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void execute();
}
You can use it like this:

MyFunctionalInterface obj = () -> System.out.println("Running");
obj.execute();
ðŸ”§ Built-in Functional Interfaces (from java.util.function):
Runnable â€“ no arguments, no return

Supplier<T> â€“ returns a result, takes no input

Consumer<T> â€“ takes input, returns nothing

Function<T, R> â€“ takes input, returns output

Predicate<T> â€“ takes input, returns boolean
