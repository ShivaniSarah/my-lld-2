How would you debug a deadlock in production?

Debugging a deadlock in production is tricky but solvable with the right tools and process. Here‚Äôs a practical step-by-step guide for Java-based systems:

üîç Step-by-Step Guide to Debug a Deadlock in Production
‚úÖ 1. Detect Symptoms of Deadlock
Symptoms:

High CPU usage

Hanging threads

Requests time out

Logs stop progressing

You may see logs like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Thread X waiting to acquire lock held by Thread Y
‚úÖ 2. Capture Thread Dump
Use any of the following methods on the running JVM:

üîß With jstack:
bash
Copy
Edit
jstack <PID> > threaddump.txt
üîß From within code:
java
Copy
Edit
Thread.getAllStackTraces()
üîß With tools:
VisualVM

JConsole

JMC (Java Mission Control)

‚úÖ 3. Analyze the Thread Dump
Look for:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Found one Java-level deadlock:
"Thread-1":
  waiting to lock monitor 0x000000001,
  which is held by "Thread-2"

"Thread-2":
  waiting to lock monitor 0x000000002,
  which is held by "Thread-1"
This shows a circular wait = deadlock.

‚úÖ 4. Identify the Code Paths
Find what these threads were doing:

Look for synchronized, ReentrantLock, wait, join, etc.

Trace through method calls to see lock acquisition order.

üîç Look for two or more threads acquiring locks in different orders ‚Äî this is the root of most deadlocks.

‚úÖ 5. Resolve the Deadlock


| Fix Type                        | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lock ordering**               | Always acquire locks in the **same order** in all threads              |
| **Try-lock + timeout**          | Use `tryLock(timeout)` to avoid waiting forever                        |
| **Avoid nested locks**          | Flatten locking hierarchy where possible                               |
| **Use higher-level constructs** | Prefer `ConcurrentHashMap`, `ExecutorService`, etc., over manual locks |
| **Timeout detection**           | Detect long-held locks and alert/log                                   |



‚úÖ 6. Monitor and Alert
Integrate tools like:

New Relic / Dynatrace / AppDynamics

Prometheus + Grafana

Thread dump analyzer in ELK Stack

Use alerts for:

Long GC pauses

Stuck threads

Request latency spikes

üõ† Example Deadlock Code
java
Copy
Edit
public class DeadlockExample {
    static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                sleep();
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 got lock2");
                }
            }
        }).start();

        new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                sleep();
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 got lock1");
                }
            }
        }).start();
    }

    static void sleep() {
        try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    }
}
‚úÖ Summary

| Step | Action                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Detect symptoms (hang, timeout, CPU)     |
| 2    | Capture thread dump (`jstack`, VisualVM) |
| 3    | Find deadlocked threads                  |
| 4    | Analyze locking order                    |
| 5    | Fix using lock ordering / tryLock        |
| 6    | Add monitoring and alerting              |
