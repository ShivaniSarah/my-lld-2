Design a Concurrent Web Server
Handle HTTP requests using a thread pool.
Support timeouts, back-pressure, and graceful shutdown.


Multithreaded Metrics Aggregator
Design a service to collect metrics (CPU, memory, custom events) from multiple sources in parallel.
Ensure correct aggregation and time-window support.


Distributed Lock Implementation with Threads
Simulate a distributed lock mechanism like Zookeeper or Redis Redlock using local threads.


Multithreaded Web Scraper with Retry & Throttling
Ensure you do not violate rate limits.
Retry failed requests with exponential backoff.
