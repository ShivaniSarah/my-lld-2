Compare Spinlocks vs Blocking Locks


ChatGPT said:
Here's a clear comparison of Spinlocks vs Blocking Locks in Java and concurrent programming in general:

üîÅ Spinlock
A thread continuously checks (spins) until the lock becomes available.

‚õî Blocking Lock
A thread is suspended (blocked) by the OS when the lock is unavailable.

üß† Conceptual Differences

| Feature          | **Spinlock**                             | **Blocking Lock**                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Waiting behavior | Busy-wait loop (spins on CPU)            | Suspends thread, yielding CPU                  |
| Latency          | Very low (no context switch)             | Higher (involves OS scheduler)                 |
| CPU usage        | High (burns CPU while waiting)           | Low (no CPU used when blocked)                 |
| Fairness         | Typically unfair                         | Often fair (e.g., `ReentrantLock` fair mode)   |
| Best for         | **Short, uncontended critical sections** | **Long or highly-contended critical sections** |
| Starvation risk  | High (no queueing)                       | Lower (threads often queued by scheduler)      |



üß™ Java Implementations
‚úÖ Spinlock (custom)
java
Copy
Edit
class SpinLock {
    private final AtomicBoolean lock = new AtomicBoolean(false);

    public void lock() {
        while (!lock.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
            // Busy wait (spin)
        }
    }

    public void unlock() {
        lock.set(false);
    }
}
‚úÖ Blocking Lock (standard)
java
Copy
Edit
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

lock.lock();   // blocks if unavailable
try {
    // critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
‚ö° Performance Implications


| Condition                              | **Recommended Lock Type**           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Low contention, very fast lock logic   | Spinlock                            |
| High contention or long-held locks     | Blocking lock (e.g., ReentrantLock) |
| Realtime systems, avoid context switch | Spinlock                            |
| General-purpose multi-core programs    | Blocking lock                       |



üîß Hybrid: Adaptive Locks
Some JVMs or OS kernels use adaptive locks:

Spin for a short time

Then block if the lock is still unavailable

‚úÖ Summary

|                 | **Spinlock**               | **Blocking Lock**               |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| üîÅ CPU          | High usage                 | Efficient                       |
| üß© Suitable for | Very short sections        | Most general workloads          |
| ‚è± Latency       | Ultra-low                  | Higher (context switching)      |
| üß† Java usage   | Custom via `AtomicBoolean` | `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock` |
