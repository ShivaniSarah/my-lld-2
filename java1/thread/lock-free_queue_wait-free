üîß Why Use Lock-Free Data Structures?
Higher throughput

Lower latency

Better scalability under contention

Avoid deadlocks, priority inversion, and thread starvation

üöÄ Design: Lock-Free Queue (Michael‚ÄìScott Queue)
The classic lock-free queue is a FIFO queue using AtomicReference.

üß† Key Concepts:
Head and Tail pointers using AtomicReference

Nodes with value and next

CAS (Compare-And-Swap) to atomically update pointers

Lock free vs wait free
ChatGPT said:
Lock-free and wait-free are both types of non-blocking concurrency in multithreaded programming. They aim to avoid problems like deadlocks and priority inversion that arise with traditional locking mechanisms. Here's a quick comparison:

Lock-Free
Definition: Guarantees that at least one thread will make progress in a finite number of steps.

Progress: System-wide progress is ensured, but individual threads may starve.

Starvation: Possible ‚Äî a thread might retry indefinitely due to contention.

Implementation: Typically uses atomic operations like CAS (Compare-And-Swap).

Use Case: When you want to ensure overall throughput and reduce contention compared to locks.

Wait-Free
Definition: Guarantees that every thread will complete its operation in a finite number of steps.

Progress: Individual thread progress is guaranteed.

Starvation: Impossible ‚Äî no thread waits indefinitely.

Implementation: Much harder and more complex to implement than lock-free.

Use Case: Real-time systems or applications where per-thread fairness and bounded execution time are critical.

Analogy:
Lock-free is like a traffic intersection without lights but with the rule "someone must go eventually."

Wait-free is like a round-robin scheduler ‚Äî everyone gets a guaranteed turn.

Summary Table:
Feature.        	Lock-Free	    Wait-Free
Thread Progress. 	Not guaranteed	Guaranteed
System Progress	     Guaranteed	    Guaranteed
Starvation.          	Possible	Impossible
Complexity	            Moderate.  	High
Performance	Generally good	May have overhead

Let me know if you want to see example Java code illustrating the difference.

Here's a simple illustration of lock-free vs wait-free using Java and AtomicInteger:

1. Lock-Free Counter (using CAS)
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class LockFreeCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        while (true) {
            int current = count.get();
            int updated = current + 1;
            if (count.compareAndSet(current, updated)) {
                break; // Success
            }
            // else retry
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
Explanation:

Uses compareAndSet (CAS) for optimistic concurrency.

Lock-free: at least one thread will succeed eventually, but a thread may spin indefinitely if contention is high.

2. Wait-Free Counter (bounded steps using array per thread)
This is a simplified wait-free counter for a known number of threads using thread-local slots.

java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class WaitFreeCounter {
    private final AtomicInteger[] slots;

    public WaitFreeCounter(int numThreads) {
        slots = new AtomicInteger[numThreads];
        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            slots[i] = new AtomicInteger(0);
        }
    }

    public void increment(int threadId) {
        slots[threadId].incrementAndGet(); // O(1) ‚Äî guaranteed bounded time
    }

    public int getTotal() {
        int sum = 0;
        for (AtomicInteger slot : slots) {
            sum += slot.get();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
Usage:

java
Copy
Edit
WaitFreeCounter counter = new WaitFreeCounter(numThreads);
counter.increment(threadId);  // threadId is fixed per thread
Explanation:

Each thread works on its own slot ‚Äî no contention.

Guarantees bounded execution time per operation.

Wait-free, but only works if thread IDs are pre-assigned and limited.

Would you like an example with threads using both counters to show the difference under contention?

        executor.shutdown();

        System.out.println("Lock-Free Count: " + lockFreeCounter.getCount());
        System.out.println("Wait-Free Count: " + waitFreeCounter.getTotal());

        System.out.println("Lock-Free Time (ms): " + (endLockFree - startLockFree) / 1_000_000);
        System.out.println("Wait-Free Time (ms): " + (endWaitFree - startWaitFree) / 1_000_000);
    }
}
What This Shows:
Both counters should reach numThreads * incrementsPerThread.

Lock-free may take longer due to retries on contention.

Wait-free performs more consistently, but needs pre-allocated thread IDs.
