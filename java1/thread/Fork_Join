✅ What is the Fork/Join Framework in Java?
The Fork/Join Framework is a Java concurrency framework designed for parallelism, where a task is split (forked) into smaller subtasks that are processed concurrently, and then the results are combined (joined).

📦 Introduced in Java 7 under java.util.concurrent.

🔧 Core Idea
Divide and conquer large problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems, solving them in parallel, and then combining results.

⚙️ Components
ForkJoinPool – A specialized thread pool optimized for recursive, divide-and-conquer tasks.

ForkJoinTask – Abstract base for tasks. Two main subclasses:

RecursiveAction – for tasks that don’t return a result

RecursiveTask<V> – for tasks that return a result

🧠 When to Use It

| Scenario                              | Use Fork/Join? |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Large problem that can be divided     | ✅ Yes          |
| CPU-bound computations (not I/O)      | ✅ Yes          |
| Recursive algorithms (like quicksort) | ✅ Yes          |
| Simple tasks or I/O-bound tasks       | ❌ No           |


✳️ Example: Sum of an Array Using RecursiveTask

import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ForkJoinSum extends RecursiveTask<Long> {
    private static final int THRESHOLD = 3;
    private final long[] numbers;
    private final int start, end;

    public ForkJoinSum(long[] numbers, int start, int end) {
        this.numbers = numbers;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Long compute() {
        int length = end - start;
        if (length <= THRESHOLD) {
            long sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) sum += numbers[i];
            return sum;
        }

        int mid = start + length / 2;
        ForkJoinSum left = new ForkJoinSum(numbers, start, mid);
        ForkJoinSum right = new ForkJoinSum(numbers, mid, end);

        left.fork();                  // Run left task asynchronously
        long rightResult = right.compute();  // Compute right in current thread
        long leftResult = left.join();       // Wait for left task

        return leftResult + rightResult;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        ForkJoinSum task = new ForkJoinSum(arr, 0, arr.length);
        long result = pool.invoke(task);

        System.out.println("Total sum: " + result);
    }
}


✅ Benefits
Uses work-stealing: idle threads can "steal" work from busy threads.

Optimized for multi-core processors.

Handles recursive, parallelizable workloads efficiently.

🛑 Avoid If:
Your task is I/O-bound or not parallelizable.

Tasks are too small and create overhead without gain.

You need to wait/block on external resources (network, DB, etc.)
