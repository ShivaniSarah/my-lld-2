Concurrency Patterns & Optimizations


Here’s a curated guide to Concurrency Patterns & Optimizations in Java — covering battle-tested patterns, when to use them, and how to apply them effectively:

🔁 1. Producer–Consumer
Problem: Coordinate work between threads generating data (producers) and processing it (consumers).
Java Tool: BlockingQueue (ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue)
Optimization: Use bounded queues for backpressure.
Pattern Code:

java
Copy
Edit
BlockingQueue<Task> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100);
🚦 2. Thread Pool (ExecutorService)
Problem: Avoid creating/destroying threads repeatedly.
Java Tool: Executors.newFixedThreadPool, ThreadPoolExecutor
Optimization:

Tune corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, queueCapacity.

Use work stealing via ForkJoinPool for divide-and-conquer.

🔐 3. Read-Write Locking
Problem: Frequent reads, infrequent writes on shared data.
Java Tool: ReentrantReadWriteLock
Optimization: Improves performance over exclusive locks for high-read systems.

🧠 4. Future & CompletableFuture
Problem: Need to compose or chain asynchronous computations.
Java Tool: CompletableFuture
Optimization: Parallel I/O, API calls, batch jobs.

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> compute()).thenApply(result -> transform(result));
🔄 5. Fork/Join & Parallelism
Problem: Divide large tasks (e.g. array search, merge sort).
Java Tool: ForkJoinPool, RecursiveTask
Optimization: Efficient CPU-bound parallelism (splitting tasks recursively).

⚡ 6. Double-Checked Locking
Problem: Lazy initialize singleton or expensive object.
Java Tool: volatile + synchronized

java
Copy
Edit
if (instance == null) {
    synchronized(...) {
        if (instance == null) instance = new Object();
    }
}
🛡 7. Immutable & Copy-On-Write
Problem: Avoid synchronization where possible.
Java Tools: Collections.unmodifiableList(), CopyOnWriteArrayList
When: Many reads, rare writes (e.g. event listeners).

🛠 8. Atomic Variables & CAS (Compare-And-Swap)
Problem: Shared counters, flags, or statistics.
Java Tools: AtomicInteger, LongAdder
Optimization: Avoid locks; use CPU-native atomic instructions.

🔁 9. Scheduled Tasks
Problem: Periodic or delayed execution.
Java Tool: ScheduledExecutorService

java
Copy
Edit
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
🔄 10. Backpressure & Rate Limiting
Problem: Producers outpacing consumers.
Tools:

ArrayBlockingQueue (bounded buffer)

Semaphore (limit concurrency)

RateLimiter from Guava

🔒 11. StampedLock for Optimized Locking
Problem: Mix of optimistic reads and exclusive writes.
Java Tool: StampedLock
When: High-read, low-write workloads with contention.

📦 12. Disruptor Pattern
Problem: Low-latency message passing with minimal contention.
Java Tool: LMAX Disruptor
When: High-performance trading systems, game engines.

🧠 General Optimizations


| Area              | Optimization                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Thread Count      | Match to CPU cores or throughput model                      |
| Thread Reuse      | Use thread pools instead of spawning raw threads            |
| Lock Granularity  | Prefer fine-grained locks or lock-free data structures      |
| False Sharing     | Avoid multiple threads writing to adjacent memory (padding) |
| Memory Visibility | Use `volatile` or `Atomic*` for visibility guarantees       |
| Cache Locality    | Avoid passing data across threads if not needed             |
