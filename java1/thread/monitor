what is monitor

Great question ‚Äî "monitor" is a core concept in Java concurrency and synchronization.

üîê What is a Monitor?
A monitor is an internal synchronization mechanism that is used to allow mutual exclusion and inter-thread communication.

In Java, every object has an associated monitor, and synchronized blocks or methods acquire that monitor to ensure only one thread can execute the protected code at a time.

üß† Think of it like:
A monitor is a lock + condition variables that belong to an object.

When you use:

java
Copy
Edit
synchronized(obj) {
   // critical section
}
The thread must acquire obj's monitor.

If another thread already holds it, your thread waits (blocks).

When the thread exits the synchronized block, it releases the monitor, allowing others to acquire it.

üîÑ What Happens Internally:
When entering a synchronized block:
JVM checks the monitor associated with the object (obj).

If available ‚Üí thread acquires the monitor (lock).

If not ‚Üí thread is blocked until the monitor becomes available.

When exiting:
The thread releases the monitor so others can enter.

üì¶ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
The method increment() is synchronized.

So, the thread must acquire the monitor of the Counter object before executing increment().

üõ† Monitor Also Manages wait() / notify()
Monitors are also responsible for coordinating threads using:

wait() ‚Äì causes a thread to release the monitor and wait

notify() ‚Äì wakes up a thread waiting on the monitor

notifyAll() ‚Äì wakes up all threads waiting on that monitor

These can only be called from within synchronized blocks, because you need to hold the monitor to interact with its wait set.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Monitor                    | An internal lock + wait/notify mechanism tied to every Java object |
| Acquired by                | Entering a synchronized block or method                            |
| One thread at a time       | Ensures **mutual exclusion** inside synchronized blocks            |
| Inter-thread communication | Enabled via `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`                    |
