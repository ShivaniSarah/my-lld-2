what is monitor

Great question ‚Äî "monitor" is a core concept in Java concurrency and synchronization.

üîê What is a Monitor?
A monitor is an internal synchronization mechanism that is used to allow mutual exclusion and inter-thread communication.

In Java, every object has an associated monitor, and synchronized blocks or methods acquire that monitor to ensure only one thread can execute the protected code at a time.

üß† Think of it like:
A monitor is a lock + condition variables that belong to an object.

When you use:

java
Copy
Edit
synchronized(obj) {
   // critical section
}
The thread must acquire obj's monitor.

If another thread already holds it, your thread waits (blocks).

When the thread exits the synchronized block, it releases the monitor, allowing others to acquire it.

üîÑ What Happens Internally:
When entering a synchronized block:
JVM checks the monitor associated with the object (obj).

If available ‚Üí thread acquires the monitor (lock).

If not ‚Üí thread is blocked until the monitor becomes available.

When exiting:
The thread releases the monitor so others can enter.

üì¶ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}
The method increment() is synchronized.

So, the thread must acquire the monitor of the Counter object before executing increment().

üõ† Monitor Also Manages wait() / notify()
Monitors are also responsible for coordinating threads using:

wait() ‚Äì causes a thread to release the monitor and wait

notify() ‚Äì wakes up a thread waiting on the monitor

notifyAll() ‚Äì wakes up all threads waiting on that monitor

These can only be called from within synchronized blocks, because you need to hold the monitor to interact with its wait set.

so in synchronized , singleton constructor initialization , since its not simple read write or compound , without volatile, reordering will happen and thread will not hold the monitor for it

‚úÖ You're absolutely right ‚Äî and let's clarify and lock it down with precision.

üîÅ In Singleton with synchronized (without volatile):
You're correct that object construction is not a simple read/write or compound operation ‚Äî it involves multiple low-level steps, and reordering is legal without volatile.

These steps (not atomic):
java
Copy
Edit
instance = new Singleton();  // breaks into:
1. Allocate memory for Singleton
2. Initialize the object (constructor)
3. Assign reference to instance
‚ùó JVM or CPU may legally reorder this to:
java
Copy
Edit
1. Allocate memory
3. Assign instance reference
2. Run constructor
This means:

Another thread may see a non-null instance and use it before it is fully initialized ‚Äî which is a serious bug.

ü§î Why synchronized doesn't fix this?
Let‚Äôs look at the classic double-checked locking code:

java
Copy
Edit
if (instance == null) {                  // 1Ô∏è‚É£ unsynchronized check
    synchronized (Singleton.class) {
        if (instance == null) {          // 2Ô∏è‚É£ synchronized block
            instance = new Singleton();  // üí• unsafe without volatile
        }
    }
}
Here‚Äôs the core issue:
The first if (instance == null) is not synchronized, so no monitor is held.

Even inside the synchronized block:

synchronized ensures mutual exclusion and memory visibility at block boundaries (enter/exit).

But without volatile, it does not prevent reordering inside the constructor or between threads.

Therefore, a thread could:

Partially construct the Singleton

Assign it to instance

Exit the block

Another thread, reading instance outside any synchronization, can see the partially initialized object.

üß† Important Rule:
synchronized prevents reordering across synchronized block boundaries (enter/exit), but it does not guarantee safe publication unless all access (read/write) is within synchronized blocks.

‚úÖ Why volatile is necessary:
Declaring instance as volatile:

java
Copy
Edit
private static volatile Singleton instance;
Adds a happens-before relationship:

Ensures writes to the object before publishing (instance = obj) are visible to any thread reading instance.

Prevents reordering:

Step 3 (assignment) will not be moved before step 2 (constructor).

So now:

One thread safely initializes and publishes

Other threads either see null or a fully constructed Singleton

üîê Analogy:
Imagine:

synchronized is like a security guard watching a room's entrance/exit

But if someone sneaks stuff into the room and puts it on the shelf before assembling it, the guard doesn‚Äôt notice

volatile is like adding a rule: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt put it on the shelf until it‚Äôs 100% built and checked‚Äù

synchronized prevents reordering across synchronized block boundaries (enter/exit), but it does not guarantee safe publication unless all access (read/write) is within synchronized blocks.

but new Singleton() was inside synchronized why does synchronized not prevent reordering instruction broken by new Singleton() ?



2/2

ChatGPT said:
This is the crux of safe object publication, and your question gets to the heart of the Java Memory Model (JMM).

Let‚Äôs explain why synchronized alone is not enough even when new Singleton() is inside a synchronized block.

üîç Let's break it down:
Code:

if (instance == null) {
    synchronized (Singleton.class) {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // üî• Potential reordering here
        }
    }
}


üî® Breakdown of new Singleton():
This operation is not atomic. It gets compiled into three distinct steps:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Allocate memory
2. Initialize object (constructor)
3. Assign reference to variable
üîÅ What can go wrong:
‚ö†Ô∏è Reordering:
Because of compiler and CPU optimizations, steps 2 and 3 can be reordered like this:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Allocate memory
3. Assign reference to instance
2. Run constructor
This means another thread may see a non-null instance before the constructor has run, leading to a partially initialized object.

üö´ Why synchronized doesn‚Äôt fix this (alone):
‚úÖ synchronized guarantees:
Mutual exclusion: only one thread executes inside the synchronized block at a time.

Visibility: writes made by one thread before exiting the block are visible to another thread after entering the block.

‚ùå But here‚Äôs the subtle issue:
synchronized does not apply to instructions inside the object constructor itself, i.e., inside new Singleton().

Reordering inside a method or constructor is allowed if it does not violate intra-thread semantics.

üß® The assignment instance = new Singleton() happens in the block ‚Äî but:
The instance reference may be published to other threads before the constructor finishes.

If another thread sees a non-null reference to instance outside the synchronized block (i.e., in the first if (instance == null)), it can try to use it before it‚Äôs initialized.

‚úÖ Why volatile is required:
Adding volatile to instance:

java
Copy
Edit
private static volatile Singleton instance;
Has two effects:

Prevents reordering of steps 2 and 3

Ensures visibility: once one thread writes to instance, other threads will see the fully constructed object

üß† Summary Table

| Mechanism      | Prevents Reordering of `new` steps?     | Ensures Safe Publication?            | Prevents Early Read? |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `synchronized` | ‚ùå No (inside constructor or assignment) | ‚ùå Only if all access is synchronized | ‚ùå Not outside lock   |
| `volatile`     | ‚úÖ Yes                                   | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚úÖ Yes                |


Even though instance = new Singleton(); is inside a synchronized block, that synchronization does not prevent the compiler or CPU from reordering instructions inside the constructor or assignment. Only volatile introduces the happens-before guarantee that ensures correct ordering and visibility.
