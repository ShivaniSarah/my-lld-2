Q. memory management in java and allocation of integers , real numbers and string and how they are used in run time ? tell for modern java ?


Ans.


In modern Java (Java 17+), memory management and the runtime handling of data types like integers,
real numbers (floating-point), and strings follow certain principles largely governed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

ðŸ”· 1. Memory Management in Java
Java handles memory automatically, using:

âž¤ Heap Memory
Stores objects, including Integer, Double, String, custom classes, etc.

Managed by the Garbage Collector (GC).

Divided into:

Young Generation (short-lived objects)

Old Generation (long-lived objects)

Metaspace (class metadata)

âž¤ Stack Memory
Stores primitive values and references to objects.

Method calls, local variables, and function call chains live here.

Each thread has its own stack.

âž¤ Registers and Native Heap
Handled internally by the JVM and native code, rarely user-controlled.

ðŸ”· 2. Primitive vs. Wrapper Types
Type	Memory Location	Usage
int, float, double	Stack (if local), Heap (if inside objects)	Primitive types
Integer, Double	Heap (Boxed objects)	Wrapper objects
String	Heap + String pool	Immutable object

ðŸ”· 3. Allocation and Use at Runtime

âœ… Integers (int, Integer)

int is a primitive: 4 bytes (32 bits), stored in stack if local.
int a = 10;

Integer is an object, stored in heap, with some caching for small values (-128 to 127).
Integer b = 10; // uses Integer.valueOf() internally, uses cache

Autoboxing:
Integer b = 10; // converts int to Integer

Unboxing:
int c = b; // converts Integer to int

âœ… Real Numbers (float, double)

float (32-bit), double (64-bit): primitive types.
Default real number in Java is double.
double d = 3.14;
Float fObj = 3.14f; // autoboxing to Float

Like int, used in stack or heap depending on context.

âœ… String

Refer: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-constant-pool-in-java/

String is a reference type, stored on the heap.
Immutable: any modification creates a new object.

String Constant / Literal pool (interning):
Java maintains a pool of unique strings in memory.

Example:

String s1 = "hello"; // uses string pool
String s2 = new String("hello"); // new object on heap
String s3 = "hello";
System.out.println((s1==s2)+" "+ (s1==s3));    // false true


class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "hello"; // uses string pool
        StringBuilder s2 = new StringBuilder("hello"); // new object on heap
        String s3 = "hello";
        System.out.println((s1==s2.toString())+" "+ (s1==s3));  // false true
    }
}


Runtime usage:
Strings used often in method calls, logging, I/O, etc.

Heavy use of StringBuilder or StringBuffer for efficiency when mutating.

ðŸ”· 4. Garbage Collection (GC)

Unused objects are cleaned up automatically.

Modern JVM uses G1 GC, ZGC, or Shenandoah for low-pause GC.

Efficient memory management helps prevent leaks and improve performance.

ðŸ”· 5. Escape Analysis and Scalar Replacement (Modern JVM Optimization)

Escape analysis detects if an object can be allocated on the stack instead of heap.

Scalar replacement breaks an object into its primitive fields for optimization.

These are done at runtime by JIT compiler, reducing memory pressure.

ðŸ”· Summary Table

Data Type        |   	Stored In	       |  Heap or Stack          |  	Mutable	          |  GC Tracked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int, double	     |    Primitive	       |  Stack (or in object)	 |      Yes        	    |    No
Integer, Double  | 	  Object           |	Heap	                 |      No(Immutable)	  |    Yes
String	         |    Object           |  Heap + Pool	           |      No	            |    Yes

ðŸ”· Best Practices

Use primitives when possible to avoid GC overhead.

Use StringBuilder for concatenations in loops.

Avoid new String("...") â€” prefer string literals.

Be aware of autoboxing in performance-critical code.
