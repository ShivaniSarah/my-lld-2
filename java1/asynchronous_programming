These terms—Future, CompletableFuture, Promise, Callable, CompletionStage—are related concepts in
asynchronous programming and concurrency in Java (and more broadly in programming). 
Here’s how they connect and differ, focusing mostly on Java:

1. Future
Represents the result of an asynchronous computation that may not be done yet.

Provides methods to check if the task is complete, wait for it (get()), or cancel it.

Limitation: You can’t easily chain or compose futures; blocking calls (get()) are common.

Example: ExecutorService.submit(Callable) returns a Future.

2. Callable
A functional interface representing a task that returns a result and may throw an exception.

Like Runnable but with a return value.

Used to submit tasks to executor services that return Futures.

java
Copy
Edit
Callable<String> task = () -> "Result";
Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
3. CompletableFuture
Extends Future with a powerful, non-blocking API.

Can be explicitly completed by a thread (manually or automatically).

Supports functional-style chaining and composition of asynchronous tasks.

Implements CompletionStage interface.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
    .thenApply(s -> s + " World")
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);
4. CompletionStage
An interface introduced in Java 8 that defines a stage of a possibly asynchronous computation.

Provides many methods for composing, combining, or consuming stages.

CompletableFuture implements this interface.

Promotes a declarative, functional style of async programming.

5. Promise
Not a built-in Java class, but a general programming concept (borrowed from JavaScript).

Represents a writable Future — something that will be completed in the future by some code.

CompletableFuture in Java acts like a Promise + Future — you can complete it (fulfill or fail) and consumers can attach callbacks.

Explain the use of Future and CompletableFuture.

✅ Future vs CompletableFuture in Java
Both Future and CompletableFuture are used to represent asynchronous computations, but CompletableFuture is more powerful and flexible.

🔹 1. Future (Java 5)
Represents a result of an async computation.

You submit it to an ExecutorService and blockingly wait for the result.

Cannot be manually completed or chained.

✳️ Example:
java
Copy
Edit
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 42;
});

Integer result = future.get(); // ⏳ Blocks
System.out.println(result);
🔹 2. CompletableFuture (Java 8+)
Supports non-blocking, reactive-style programming.

You can chain multiple tasks using .thenApply(), .thenAccept(), .thenCompose(), etc.

Supports manual completion and error handling.

✳️ Example (Non-blocking):
java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    return 42;
});

future.thenApply(x -> x * 2)
      .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

🆚 Key Differences

| Feature                | `Future`      | `CompletableFuture`                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Introduced in          | Java 5        | Java 8                                 |
| Blocking               | Yes (`get()`) | Optional (non-blocking chaining)       |
| Manual Completion      | No            | Yes (`complete()`)                     |
| Chaining               | No            | Yes (`thenApply`, `thenCompose`, etc.) |
| Exception Handling     | No            | Yes (`exceptionally`, `handle`)        |
| Combine Multiple Tasks | Limited       | Easy with `allOf`, `anyOf`             |


🧠 Use Cases

| Scenario                             | Use                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Simple async task with blocking wait | `Future`            |
| Reactive pipelines, complex flows    | `CompletableFuture` |
| Manual completion, composition       | `CompletableFuture` |
| Need timeout + cancel only           | `Future`            |

🔁 Application Differences: Future vs CompletableFuture


| Use Case                                    | Future                            | CompletableFuture                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 Basic async computation                  | ✅ Submit task, wait with `get()`  | ✅ Use `supplyAsync()` and chain results   |
| 🔄 Chaining multiple async steps            | ❌ Requires manual threading logic | ✅ Easily chain with `thenApply()`, etc.   |
| 🚦 Non-blocking APIs                        | ❌ Blocks on `get()`               | ✅ Fully non-blocking                      |
| 📛 Handling errors in async flow            | ❌ Catch after `get()` only        | ✅ Use `exceptionally()`, `handle()`       |
| 🔗 Combine multiple async tasks             | ❌ Very complex                    | ✅ `allOf()`, `anyOf()` make it simple     |
| ⚙️ Manual control / programmatic completion | ❌ Not supported                   | ✅ `complete()`, `completeExceptionally()` |
| ⏱ Timeouts / Cancellation                   | ✅ `cancel()`, `get(timeout)`      | ✅ + fine-grained timeout handling         |
| 🔄 Retry on failure                         | ❌ Hard to implement cleanly       | ✅ Can use `.handle()` or retry logic      |
| 📶 HTTP or database async pipelines         | 🚫 Limited and blocking           | ✅ Fully async, can process on response    |


🔧 Examples of Applications
✅ Future is Good For:
Simple tasks like background file parsing or computation.

You don't need chaining or non-blocking results.

Example: Submitting a task to calculate Fibonacci number.


Future<Integer> fibFuture = executor.submit(() -> fibonacci(40));


✅ CompletableFuture is Great For:
Example Use Case: Async HTTP Call → Parse → Save to DB → Notify User

CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchDataFromAPI())
    .thenApply(response -> parseJson(response))
    .thenApply(data -> saveToDatabase(data))
    .thenAccept(savedId -> notifyUser(savedId))
    .exceptionally(ex -> {
        logError(ex);
        return null;
    });


Fully non-blocking

Chained actions

Error handling in flow

Ideal for microservices, parallel processing, event-driven apps

🧠 Summary Mnemonic:


Future         = Simple async + blocking + limited control  
CompletableFuture = Rich async + non-blocking + composable + error handling
