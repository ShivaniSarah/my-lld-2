These terms—Future, CompletableFuture, Promise, Callable, CompletionStage—are related concepts in
asynchronous programming and concurrency in Java (and more broadly in programming). 
Here’s how they connect and differ, focusing mostly on Java:

1. Future
Represents the result of an asynchronous computation that may not be done yet.

Provides methods to check if the task is complete, wait for it (get()), or cancel it.

Limitation: You can’t easily chain or compose futures; blocking calls (get()) are common.

Example: ExecutorService.submit(Callable) returns a Future.

2. Callable
A functional interface representing a task that returns a result and may throw an exception.

Like Runnable but with a return value.

Used to submit tasks to executor services that return Futures.

java
Copy
Edit
Callable<String> task = () -> "Result";
Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
3. CompletableFuture
Extends Future with a powerful, non-blocking API.

Can be explicitly completed by a thread (manually or automatically).

Supports functional-style chaining and composition of asynchronous tasks.

Implements CompletionStage interface.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
    .thenApply(s -> s + " World")
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);
4. CompletionStage
An interface introduced in Java 8 that defines a stage of a possibly asynchronous computation.

Provides many methods for composing, combining, or consuming stages.

CompletableFuture implements this interface.

Promotes a declarative, functional style of async programming.

5. Promise
Not a built-in Java class, but a general programming concept (borrowed from JavaScript).

Represents a writable Future — something that will be completed in the future by some code.

CompletableFuture in Java acts like a Promise + Future — you can complete it (fulfill or fail) and consumers can attach callbacks.
