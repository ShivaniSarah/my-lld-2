Yes, one core of a CPU typically executes only one thread at a time, but there's more nuance depending on the CPU architecture:

Every thread has a priority.
Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower priority.
Each thread may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in some thread creates a new Thread object,
the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the creating thread, 
and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon.

From a user perspective,
a daemon thread in Java is a background helper thread that performs tasks behind the scenes — 
  and doesn't block the application from exiting.

🔧 What is a daemon thread (in simple terms)?
  
It's a low-priority background thread.

The JVM will not wait for daemon threads to finish when the main thread exits along with all non-daemon/ user/ foreground threads.

The JVM shuts down once all non-daemon (user) threads finish — even if daemon threads are still running.


On a single core, if both user threads and daemon threads exist, the daemon thread is not killed — it is interleaved with the user thread via time-sharing (context switching), as managed by the operating system and JVM.

🔄 Thread Scheduling on a Single Core
The CPU core can run only one thread at a time, but the OS rapidly switches between threads, giving the illusion of parallelism. This includes:

User threads

Daemon threads

So:

The daemon thread is interleaved with user threads.

The JVM scheduler (which uses underlying OS scheduling) decides when each thread runs, regardless of whether it's a daemon or not.

☠️ When Is a Daemon Thread Killed?
Daemon threads are not killed arbitrarily. They run as long as:

The JVM is alive

There is any user thread running

Once all user threads finish, the JVM will:

Automatically terminate the process.

Kill all remaining daemon threads (abruptly, without cleanup).


  | Situation                           | What Happens                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Daemon + User threads on 1 core     | Daemon is **interleaved**, **not killed**  |
| All user threads finish             | **Daemon is killed**, and JVM exits        |
| JVM running with active user thread | Daemon thread gets scheduled (time-shared) |




  🧠 Think of it like:
User thread: Main job

Daemon thread: Background helper

They cooperate, but the user thread determines JVM lifetime.

Let me know if you want a Java code example to illustrate this.



  Yes — in Java, foreground threads exist, but they are not explicitly called that. They are simply called user threads (as opposed to daemon threads).

✅ Foreground Thread = User Thread
A foreground thread is any normal thread that keeps the JVM alive.
These are the threads that:

Run your main application logic.

Are non-daemon (i.e., thread.isDaemon() == false by default).

Prevent the JVM from shutting down until they complete.

🆚 Daemon vs. Foreground (User) Thread


  | Feature                     | Foreground (User) Thread | Daemon Thread               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Keeps JVM alive?            | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                        |
| Default type?               | ✅ Yes (non-daemon)       | ❌ No (must be set manually) |
| Suitable for critical work? | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                        |
| Can be abruptly killed?     | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes (when JVM exits)      |




  public class ThreadTypesDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread running...");
        });

        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
        });
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);

        userThread.start();
        daemonThread.start();

        // JVM will wait for userThread, but not daemonThread
    }
}




🔍 Summary
There's no keyword foreground, but all non-daemon threads are effectively foreground threads.

JVM keeps running as long as at least one user thread is alive.

Once all foreground (user) threads are done, JVM terminates, and any daemon threads are killed immediately.

✅ Best Practice
Use user threads for important, visible, or user-facing work.

Use daemon threads only for non-essential background tasks (like cleanup, logging, monitoring).

Let me know if you'd like a real-world analogy or diagram!



  do user threads interrupt daemon thread


  ❌ User threads do NOT automatically interrupt or stop daemon threads.
🔍 What actually happens:
User threads and daemon threads can run independently.

When the last user thread finishes, the JVM shuts down, and any running daemon threads are terminated abruptly.

No explicit interruption or InterruptedException is triggered — the JVM just kills daemon threads immediately, even in the middle of execution.




  🧠 Think of it like this:
Daemon threads live only as long as there are user threads running.
When the last user thread finishes, the JVM says:
“We’re done here,” and pulls the plug on all daemon threads without warning.



  public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread daemon = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon running...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    System.out.println("Daemon interrupted");
                }
            }
        });
        daemon.setDaemon(true);
        daemon.start();

        Thread user = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("User thread done.");
        });
        user.start();
    }
}


o/p

User thread done.


  ➡️ JVM exits almost immediately after the user thread finishes, and the daemon thread is silently terminated — no interruption, no warning.

| Behavior                                                  | Does it happen?                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| User thread **automatically** interrupts daemon?          | ❌ No                                    |
| Daemon threads get interrupted when JVM shuts down?       | ❌ No (they are **terminated abruptly**) |
| Can user thread **explicitly** interrupt a daemon thread? | ✅ Yes (via `thread.interrupt()`)        |


    If you want clean shutdown for daemon-like behavior, you should:

Use user threads with proper interrupt handling.

Or use daemon threads + shutdown hooks + cooperative checks (like Thread.interrupted()).

| 🧹 **Garbage Collection**           | Java’s internal GC thread is a daemon — it cleans memory in the background.                            |

  🔧 What is a daemon thread (in simple terms)?
It's a low-priority background thread.

The JVM will not wait for daemon threads to finish when the main thread exits.

The JVM shuts down once all non-daemon (user) threads finish — even if daemon threads are still running.



  🧠 Key Concept
Daemon threads serve the application but are not essential to keep it alive.

🚫 From a user’s perspective, what daemon threads do not do:
They don't prevent app exit.

They’re not for critical tasks (like saving user data).

If the main thread finishes — daemons are killed immediately, even mid-task.

🔍 Example

  public class DaemonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon working...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            }
        });
        t.setDaemon(true); // Mark it as daemon
        t.start();

        Thread.sleep(3000); // Main thread sleeps for 3s, then exits
        System.out.println("Main thread done.");
    }
}



Daemon working...
Daemon working...
Daemon working...
Main thread done.



  👉 After Main thread done., the JVM exits — daemon thread is abruptly killed.
