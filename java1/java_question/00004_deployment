If we deploy spring boot jar file, it has its own embedded tomcat server, we don't need server setup, just need to run jar file in EC2 container and give command java -jar filename.

war files contain web pages and not tomcat server , we need to do our own server setup and load balancing https configuration

Deploying a WAR file to AWS, particularly with your own server setup, typically involves these steps:
Provision an EC2 Instance:
Launch an Amazon EC2 instance (e.g., a Linux AMI). Choose an instance type and size appropriate for your application's needs.


Configure security groups to allow necessary inbound traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS on port 80/443, SSH on port 22 for management).


Install and Configure Java and Application Server:
Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.


Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on the instance.


Install an application server, such as Apache Tomcat, WildFly, or Jetty, which is compatible with your WAR file.


Configure the application server, including setting up environment variables, memory allocation, and user permissions.


Transfer the WAR File:
Securely transfer your compiled WAR file from your local machine to the EC2 instance. This can be done using tools like SCP or SFTP. 


Place the WAR file in the appropriate deployment directory of your application server (e.g., webapps directory for Tomcat).


Deploy the WAR File:
Manual Deployment: If using Tomcat, simply placing the WAR file in the webapps directory often triggers automatic deployment.


Application Server Management Console: Access the management console of your application server (e.g., Tomcat Manager) and use its interface to upload and deploy the WAR file.


Scripted Deployment: Create a shell script on the EC2 instance to automate the deployment process, including stopping the application server, replacing the old WAR file, and restarting the server.


Configure DNS and Load Balancing (Optional but Recommended):
Route 53: If you have a custom domain, configure Amazon Route 53 to point your domain to the EC2 instance's public IP address or an Elastic Load Balancer.


Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): For high availability and scalability, place your EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB). This distributes traffic and allows for easy scaling.


Monitoring and Maintenance:
Set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your EC2 instance and application server logs for performance and errors.


Regularly update your application server and operating system for security and performance improvements.
