In Java, both synchronized and Lock (from java.util.concurrent.locks) are used for thread synchronization — to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. However, there are several important differences between them:

🔒 synchronized (Keyword - Built-in Monitor Locks)

Type: Language-level construct.

Usage: Implicit locking via synchronized blocks or methods.

Reentrancy: Supports reentrancy automatically.

Fairness: No built-in support for fair ordering of threads.

Interruptible: Not interruptible while waiting to acquire the lock.

Timeouts: Cannot specify timeout to acquire a lock.

Condition Variables: Only one wait set per object using wait(), notify(), notifyAll().

Ease of Use: Simple and concise.

Example:

synchronized (someObject) {
    // critical section
}


🔐 Lock (Interface - java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock)



Type: API-level synchronization (more flexible and feature-rich).

Usage: Explicit locking and unlocking.

Reentrancy: ReentrantLock supports reentrancy.

Fairness: Can be fair (new ReentrantLock(true)) or non-fair.

Interruptible: Can acquire lock interruptibly via lockInterruptibly().

Timeouts: Supports tryLock(timeout, unit) to wait for a lock for a limited time.

Condition Variables: Supports multiple condition variables via newCondition().

Responsibility: Requires manual unlocking — lock() must be paired with unlock().

Example:

Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    // critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}

| Condition Support  | Single wait/notify                            | Multiple via `Condition`       |
| Deadlock Handling  | Harder to control                             | Easier with `tryLock`          |
| Performance        | Comparable; `Lock` better for high contention |                                |
| Simplicity         | Very simple                                   | More verbose/flexible          |

What are the pros and cons of using synchronized, ReentrantLock, and StampedLock in Java?


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Here's a clear and structured comparison of synchronized, ReentrantLock, and StampedLock in Java — with pros and cons of each:

✅ 1. synchronized (Intrinsic Locks)
🔹 Pros:
Simplicity: Built into the language (synchronized block or method).

Automatic release: Lock is released automatically even during exceptions.

Readable: Easy to reason about, especially for simple critical sections.

🔹 Cons:
No flexibility: Cannot try to acquire lock with timeout, cannot interrupt waiting threads.

No fairness: Threads may starve; no queueing policy.

Limited features: No support for advanced locking features like read/write locks.

🔸 When to use:
Simple mutual exclusion for short critical sections.

✅ 2. ReentrantLock (from java.util.concurrent.locks)
🔹 Pros:
Try lock: Can attempt to acquire lock with timeout.

java
Copy
Edit
if (lock.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) { ... }
Interruptible lock acquisition: Use lockInterruptibly().

Fairness: Can create with FIFO fairness policy.

java
Copy
Edit
new ReentrantLock(true);
Explicit lock/unlock: Gives more control.

🔹 Cons:
Manual unlocking required:
You must always call unlock() or risk deadlocks.

Verbose: More boilerplate code.

🔸 When to use:
Advanced scenarios with fairness, timeouts, or interruptible locks.

✅ 3. StampedLock (Java 8+)
🔹 Pros:
Read/Write locks: Optimized for scenarios with frequent reads, fewer writes.

Optimistic reads: Non-blocking read path for high-performance scenarios.

java
Copy
Edit
long stamp = lock.tryOptimisticRead();
// verify if write occurred
if (!lock.validate(stamp)) { ... }
🔹 Cons:
No reentrancy: Unlike ReentrantLock, it doesn’t support lock reentrancy.

Complex API: Optimistic reads require additional validation and care.

Manual unlock: Must remember to unlockRead, unlockWrite, or unlock.

🔸 When to use:
Performance-critical applications with many reads and few writes (e.g., caching, configuration lookup).
