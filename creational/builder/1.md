The constructor is private to prevent instantiation without the builder.

Benefits of the Builder Pattern:
Clarity: The builder pattern allows for clear and readable code, especially when dealing with multiple optional parameters.
Immutability: The created object (Car) is immutable after construction since its fields are final.
Flexibility: Different representations of the object can be created using the same builder.
