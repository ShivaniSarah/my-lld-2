give interview questions asked on design patterns
Software Design Patterns Guide said:

Got it 👍 — design pattern interview questions usually test two things:

Do you know the common patterns? (like Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.)

Can you apply them to real-world problems?

Here’s a list of common interview questions on design patterns, grouped by type:

🔹 General Questions

What are design patterns, and why are they useful?

What is the difference between a design pattern, an architecture style, and an algorithm?

Explain the difference between creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

How do design patterns improve code maintainability and flexibility?

🔹 Creational Patterns

Can you explain the Singleton pattern and its drawbacks?

How is a Factory Method different from an Abstract Factory?

When would you use the Builder pattern instead of a simple constructor?

How does the Prototype pattern handle object creation differently?

🔹 Structural Patterns

What is the difference between Adapter and Facade?

When would you use the Decorator pattern instead of subclassing?

Can you explain the Composite pattern with a real-world example?

How does the Proxy pattern help with lazy loading or security?

🔹 Behavioral Patterns

What is the difference between Strategy and State patterns?

How does the Observer pattern compare to Publish-Subscribe?

Can you explain the Command pattern and its use in undo/redo functionality?

When would you use the Template Method pattern over Strategy?

🔹 Scenario-Based Questions

You’re building a logging system where different modules need to listen to log events. Which pattern would you use? (→ Observer)

You need to switch between different payment gateways at runtime. Which pattern fits best? (→ Strategy / Factory)

You want to provide a simplified API to a complex subsystem. Which pattern would you use? (→ Facade)

You’re implementing a shopping cart where discounts can be applied dynamically. Which pattern is suitable? (→ Decorator or Strategy)

In a microservices system, how would you handle a long-running transaction across services? (→ Saga Pattern)

🔹 Tricky / Deep-Dive Questions

Can the Singleton pattern break in multi-threaded environments? How would you fix it?

Compare Factory Method vs. Dependency Injection.

What is the difference between Adapter vs. Bridge?

How does the Mediator pattern reduce coupling, and what are the trade-offs?

Why might the Visitor pattern be considered complex or controversial?

👉 Do you want me to prepare answers with examples for the most commonly asked 8–10 questions, so you’d be interview-ready?

Software Design Patterns Guide said:

Perfect 👍 Let’s go through the top 10 most common design pattern interview questions with clear answers and examples.

🔹 1. What are design patterns, and why are they useful?

Answer:
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.

They aren’t code, but templates you adapt to your situation.

They help make code reusable, maintainable, and flexible.

They give developers a shared vocabulary ("use a Singleton here" is faster than explaining a full design).

📌 Example: Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you need a single database connection, you can use the Singleton pattern.

🔹 2. Can you explain the Singleton pattern and its drawbacks?

Answer:
The Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.

✅ Use cases: Database connections, logging, configuration manager.

📌 Python sketch:

class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance


⚠️ Drawbacks:

Hard to test (acts like a hidden global variable).

Can lead to tight coupling.

Not thread-safe unless handled carefully.

🔹 3. Factory Method vs. Abstract Factory

Answer:

Factory Method: Creates one kind of product by deferring creation to subclasses.

Abstract Factory: Creates families of related products without specifying their concrete classes.

📌 Example:

Factory Method → ShapeFactory returns a Circle or Square.

Abstract Factory → GUIFactory can create a family of products (Button, Checkbox) for Windows or Mac.

🔹 4. When would you use the Builder pattern instead of a constructor?

Answer:
Use Builder when:

The object has many optional parameters.

You want to build it step by step.

📌 Example:
Instead of a constructor like

Pizza(size="Large", cheese=True, pepperoni=True, olives=False, mushrooms=True)


Builder lets you do:

pizza = PizzaBuilder().set_size("Large").add_cheese().add_pepperoni().build()


✅ Improves readability, avoids constructor overloads.

🔹 5. What is the difference between Adapter and Facade?

Answer:

Adapter: Converts one interface to another so classes can work together. (Focus: compatibility)

Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. (Focus: simplicity)

📌 Example:

Adapter → You have a European plug but need to fit it into a US socket.

Facade → You press a single button "Turn on home theater," and it turns on the TV, speakers, and DVD player behind the scenes.

🔹 6. When would you use the Decorator pattern instead of subclassing?

Answer:

Use Decorator when you want to add behavior dynamically without creating many subclasses.

📌 Example:

A Coffee object can be wrapped with MilkDecorator, then with SugarDecorator, instead of creating MilkAndSugarCoffee.

More flexible than inheritance because you can combine decorators at runtime.

🔹 7. Strategy vs. State Pattern

Answer:

Strategy: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms. (Focus: choosing different behaviors)

State: Allows an object to change behavior based on its internal state. (Focus: transitioning behaviors)

📌 Example:

Strategy → Different payment methods (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment).

State → A TCP connection changes behavior when it’s Open, Closed, or Listening.

🔹 8. Explain the Observer pattern with a real-world example

Answer:
Observer defines a one-to-many relationship where when one object changes, all its dependents get notified.

📌 Example:

Stock price updates: If the price changes, all subscribed apps/clients get notified.

UI event listeners in GUI frameworks.

✅ Promotes loose coupling.

🔹 9. What is the Command pattern, and where would you use it?

Answer:
Command encapsulates a request as an object, allowing undo/redo and queuing.

📌 Example:

In a text editor:

InsertTextCommand

DeleteTextCommand
Each command can be executed or undone.

✅ Use it when you need undo functionality or logging actions.

🔹 10. How does the Saga pattern handle distributed transactions?

Answer:
Saga is used in microservices to manage long-running transactions without a central DB transaction.

Breaks a big transaction into smaller steps.

Each step has a compensating action if something fails.

📌 Example:
Booking a trip:

Book flight ✈️

Reserve hotel 🏨

Rent car 🚗
If car rental fails → cancel hotel + cancel flight.

✅ Ensures eventual consistency.
