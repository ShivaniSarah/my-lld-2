‚úÖ Common Interview Questions: Which Design Pattern to Use When?
‚öôÔ∏è Behavioral Patterns
Which pattern would you use for a chain of operations that can stop mid-way based on conditions?

Expected: Chain of Responsibility

If multiple systems need to react to a change in a shared object, what pattern would you use?

Expected: Observer

You want to allow undo/redo functionality in your app. What pattern helps manage that?

Expected: Command

You want to traverse a complex data structure without exposing its internal structure. Which pattern?

Expected: Iterator

How would you encapsulate a request as an object so that it can be queued, logged, or undone?

Expected: Command

üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns
Your app uses multiple APIs with different interfaces. How would you standardize access to them?

Expected: Adapter

If you want to represent part-whole hierarchies like menus or file systems, which pattern would you use?

Expected: Composite

You want to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. Which pattern suits best?

Expected: Facade

To reduce object creation overhead in a system with lots of similar objects, which pattern helps?

Expected: Flyweight

üè≠ Creational Patterns
Which pattern would you use when object creation logic is complex and should be separated from usage?

Expected: Factory Method or Abstract Factory

If your system must create only one instance of a class and provide a global access point, which pattern?

Expected: Singleton

If you want to construct complex objects step-by-step, which pattern would you use?

Expected: Builder

If object creation involves copying an existing object, which pattern would you use?

Expected: Prototype

üìå Scenario-Based Questions
Which pattern would you use to decouple business logic from UI updates in a GUI application?

Expected: Observer or MVC/MVVM (higher-level architectural)

How would you implement plugin architecture where new behaviors can be added dynamically at runtime?

Expected: Strategy or Decorator

You want to restrict object instantiation but also make it thread-safe. Which pattern and what approach?

Expected: Singleton with double-checked locking

How do you design a workflow where each step may or may not process the input?

Expected: Chain of Responsibility

Which pattern allows you to change the algorithm of a class at runtime?

Expected: Strategy

üß† Advanced Design Pattern Reasoning
How would you refactor a set of conditional logic (if-else or switch-case) into a design pattern?

Expected: Strategy, State, or Command

What pattern would you use to decouple a client from complex object creation logic in a large system?

Expected: Abstract Factory or Builder

When should you use Strategy vs State pattern?

Expected: Explain that:

Strategy ‚Üí interchangeable behavior algorithms

State ‚Üí object behavior changes based on internal state

Decorator vs Proxy vs Adapter ‚Äî when to use each?

Expected: Know distinctions:

Decorator ‚Üí adds behavior

Proxy ‚Üí controls access

Adapter ‚Üí converts interfaces

üìö Bonus: Knowledge of Anti-Patterns
Can you describe any anti-patterns that arise from misuse of Singleton?

Expected: Global state, tight coupling, difficult testing

When might using the Observer pattern introduce memory leaks?

Expected: Unmanaged listener references not removed
