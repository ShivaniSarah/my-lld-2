✅ 1. Atomicity — "All or nothing"
Definition:
A transaction is atomic—it either completes entirely or not at all. If any part fails, the whole transaction is rolled back.

Example:
In a banking app:

Step 1: Debit ₹1000 from Account A

Step 2: Credit ₹1000 to Account B
If the system crashes after Step 1, the ₹1000 debit is reversed to maintain correctness.

Prevents:

Partial updates

Inconsistent data from incomplete transactions

✅ 2. Consistency — "Valid to valid state"
Definition:
A transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another, maintaining integrity constraints (like foreign keys, balance rules, etc.).

Example:
If a user registers, the email must be unique.
A transaction inserting the user enforces this rule. If the email exists, the transaction fails, keeping the database consistent.

Prevents:

Violation of business rules

Corrupt data states

Linearizable Consistency
Eventual Consistency
Causal Consistency

Conclusion - Transaction Isolation


✅ 3. Isolation — "Each transaction is independent"
Definition:
Even if transactions run concurrently, their outcome must be the same as if they had executed serially (one after the other).

Example:
Two users book the last movie ticket at the same time.
Proper isolation ensures only one gets it.

Types of Isolation Problems (prevented):

Dirty Read: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction

Non-repeatable Read: Data changes between reads in the same transaction

Phantom Read: New rows appear in a repeated query

SQL Isolation Levels (from weakest to strongest):

Read Uncommitted

Read Committed

Repeatable Read

Serializable

✅ 4. Durability — "Once committed, always there"
Definition:
After a transaction commits, the changes are permanently stored, even in case of power loss, crash, etc.

Example:
Once money is transferred and the confirmation is received, even a system crash won't lose the data—it’s stored in non-volatile memory/logs.

Ensured by:

Write-ahead logging

Redo logs

Persistent storage systems



  | Property    | Ensures                      | Example                   | Prevents              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Atomicity   | All-or-nothing execution     | Bank transfer             | Partial updates       |
| Consistency | Valid state transitions      | Unique email constraint   | Constraint violation  |
| Isolation   | Transactions don’t interfere | Concurrent booking        | Dirty/phantom reads   |
| Durability  | Committed data persists      | Order remains after crash | Data loss post-commit |


-------------------------------

Consistency ensures that a database starts in a valid state and ends in a valid state after any transaction, maintaining all integrity constraints, rules, and relationships defined.
  
  ✅ How It Works
A consistent transaction:

Obeys data types, constraints, and rules (e.g., balance must be ≥ 0).

Automatically rolls back if any rule is violated.

Preserves relationships (e.g., foreign key constraints).

✅ Example
Suppose you have two tables:

Accounts(account_id INT PRIMARY KEY, balance INT CHECK (balance >= 0))
If a transaction deducts ₹1000 from an account with ₹500, the constraint fails. Consistency ensures:

Transaction is rolled back

Database never enters an invalid state

⚠️ What It Prevents
Violating business rules

Data corruption due to incomplete or incorrect operations

Logical anomalies (e.g., account with negative balance, orphaned foreign keys)

💡 Key Point
Consistency is maintained by application rules + database constraints.
If any step violates consistency, the whole transaction fails and the DB remains unchanged.

🔍 Types of Consistency (with scenarios and how we ensure it)
In databases, consistency has different types or facets depending on context. Below are the major types:

1. Data Integrity Consistency
Scenario:
A Users table requires email to be unique. If two transactions try to insert the same email, one must fail.

Ensured by:

Primary key/unique constraints

Check constraints (CHECK (balance >= 0))

Triggers

2. Referential Consistency (Foreign Key Consistency)
Scenario:
A Orders table references Users. An order can't exist for a deleted user.

Ensured by:

Foreign key constraints (ON DELETE CASCADE, RESTRICT)

Referential integrity rules

3. Transactional Consistency
Scenario:
In a bank transfer, debit and credit must both succeed or fail together. If one part fails, rollback is needed.

Ensured by:

Atomic transactions

Rollback mechanisms

COMMIT/ROLLBACK

4. Application-Level Consistency
Scenario:
Business rule: a user can’t place more than 3 orders in a minute.

Ensured by:

Custom validations in application code

Pre-transaction checks

Stored procedures

5. Read Consistency (Concurrency-Related)
Scenario:
User A reads data while User B updates it. User A should not see half-written data.

Ensured by:

Isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ)

MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

✅ How Consistency is Ensured
Level	Technique
Schema level	Primary keys, foreign keys, check constraints
Transactional	ACID compliance, rollback on failure
Application	Validations, business rules, code guards
Runtime		Concurrency control, isolation levels
